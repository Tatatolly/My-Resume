    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Ayoo! My name is Ahmed aka Tito, I'm a Dental student/Fullstack Web Dev. I
      love the contrast in my career, dealing with coding and making someone's
      smile beautiful is something unique and I take pride in both of my
      professions. I've started coding out of passion, and now it's a full-time
      job for me. Ever since I was a kid, I used to spend hours and hours on my
      PC, and a bond was created between us and now we're bestieees. I've worked
      in Customer Support also for 3 years.
